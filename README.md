Medical Monitor Project of Health Information Management
*********************************************************
CLONING INSTRUCTIONS
=========================================================
1. Before cloning, please make sure you do not have a project called "MedMon", or "MedicalMonitor" in your Eclipse.
2. Make sure to Refactor and Rename the "appcompat_v7_3," and any or all above project names if you have one in your Eclipse or your Android Workspace.
(RENAME IT THROUGH ECLIPSE, AND NOT THROUGH WINDOWS EXPLORER!)
3. Exit Eclipse just in case.
4. Once done, go ahead and clone the MASTER Branch, which should have a folder called "MedicalMonitor," and a README file.
5. Start up Eclipse.
6. Close all other projects.
7. Go to File > Import.
8. Expand "Git" folder and click on "Projects from Git", then press NEXT.
9. Click on "Existing local repository" and click NEXT.
10. If MedMon does not exist in the list provided, Click on ADD. Otherwise SKIP to STEP 13.

12. Once it is list, click on the MedMon repository, and click FINISH.
13. Select MedMon repository and Click NEXT.

REMINDER
----------------------------------------------------
If your GITHUB application shows that you've made changes, then DO NOT COMMIT THEM!
Instead, RICHT-CLICK each of them and Click IGNORE.
--> Files to ignore:
1. .properties
2. .jar
3. appcompat folder or any unrelated project files.
4. R.java
5. AndroidManifest.xml (In some cases it is fine).

I would also recommend using Branches because it is Still better, so we can have atleast one Branch with working and error-free code. Therefore I've created a Branch called "Working Backup," where the error-free code will be placed for back-up.
